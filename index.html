      <h1>Wake up</h1>
       <p>Typically, the day begins with being woken up by one of several things. Those include: my husbands alarm that is set to an UNGODLY 6 a.m., 
          Eden (my 10 month old) screaming because she's awake and hungry, or Brooklyn (my 6 year old) jumping in the bed because somthing woke her up. 
          Sometimes, I wake up to my alarm that's set for 7:30 a.m. and I get to have a few minutes to myself before the day starts rolling.
          On a rare occasion, I wake up on my own and realize that I got to sleep in. For those days I'm greatful.

      <h2>Morning</h2>
      <p>Now that I'm awake and somewhat functioning, I muster up the energy to get the kids ready for their day. Once everyone is fed and content (usually
         the television is involed with keeping them content for a few minutes), I make a cup of coffee and sneak to the back porch to drink down the caffinated
         goodness. Side note, almost everyday I get 1 or 2 cardinals that come visit. My day is starting to look good. Dear God, I hope it stays that way! 
         But, I'm a realist. As I enter my house again, I wonder what Fresh Hell awaits me today?

      <h3>Noon</h3>
         <p> Back in the "olden days" as my daughter says, before Covid-19, I would be at work after dropping the kids off at daycare. I never thought that I would 
            miss going to the office. Now, I work from home, which isn't bad. It seems so weird that now that we social distance, we really don't go many places. 
            Anyway, up until noon, I would be in meetings for work (from home of course) and doing my thing for work while trying to balance 2 needy children. At Noon
            I would take some time to make lunch for everyone. Usually my little one takes a nap and my older one returns to whatever game, show or school assignment
            she was working on. When free choice rolls around it is YouTube. When I get a chance, I try to sneak in some schoolwork myself.

      <h4> Night</h4>
         <p> Usually our evening consists of my husband taking the girls for a walk or bike ride so I can study for a bit. On nights when I have class, I leave the house
            so that I can be focused on my class work. Have you ever tried studying or attending class with children? While it can be done, it's extremly hard to shut out 
            the noise for me. It's usually 2 kids screeching while they play with each other or the oldest yelling at the youngest because she found one of her toys and is 
            slobbering all over it. Luckily, the youngest doesn't have teeth yet. Then, we usually eat dinner while watching family television (mostly cooking shows) and
            then it's bath time. This is definitely a team effort. My husband washes one while I take the other. Girls are really cute, but the amount of hair I have to wash, 
            comb, moisturize, unknot, etc. can be rough a times.  After all of the normal bedtime activites take place, it's lights out for the kiddos. No one dare make a 
            peep for the first 20 minutes after they lay their heads down for fear of waking them up again. LOL. Then it's clean up time and bedtime for the grown ups( after 
            doing some kind of school work or work that needs attention).
